rshell is a program that is meant to behave like a terminal. It is meant to run commands like other terminals and such.

Bugs:
None of the connecters are working
Pressing enter with no input will segfault
Typing in only whitespace will cause a segfault(fixed)
commands are read onto the wrong line
echo works, but having # will cut everything out
echo will also cout a failed function call but work
entering just a comment will lead to a segfault (fixed)
