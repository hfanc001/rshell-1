rshell is a program that is meant to behave like a terminal. It is meant to run commands like other terminals and such.

Bugs:
None of the connecters are working
echo works, but having # will cut everything out
echo will also cout a failed function call but work
flags work but will give out an error message
cd does not work
semicolon and pipe and and do not work - connecters do not work
ls can run but not with MUTLTIPLE flags
